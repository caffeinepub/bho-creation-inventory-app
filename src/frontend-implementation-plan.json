Revise the color scheme to incorporate gradients, shadows, and visual effects that align with the video aesthetic while maintaining compatibility with the existing warm OKLCH color palette (avoiding blue and purple). Update typography, spacing, and component arrangement to reflect the video design. Preserve the Internet Identity authentication functionality by keeping the existing LoginButton integration. Retain all existing feature highlights (barcode scanning, stock management, real-time sync) but adapt their presentation to the new design style. Ensure responsive behavior for both mobile and desktop viewports. Do not modify the authentication mechanism or related hooks."
